An AI simulation of the genetic evolution of animals within a closed ecosystem

Scene Ecosystem:
- Each day lasts a certain amount of time
- At night, night survivability attribute determins setup of the next day
- Creatures have an amount of health point determined by their vitality attribute, at 0 they will die
- Creatures have seperate Health, Hunger and Thirst statuses which determines behaviour

Creature attributes:
Vitality - Health points & regeneration speed
Strength - Damage dealt
Speed - Running and roaming speed
Eye Sight - Distance can see
Night Survivability - Liklihood of dying, surviving or multiplying during the night
					- Also influences how soon creatures will start to seek shelter

- Creatures will have a random number of points within a range, and allocate these points randomly to each attribute
	e.g. from 40 to 50 points, creature gets 48 points to be distributed randomly 


Health: Healthy, Wounded, Badly Wounded, Mortally wounded, Dead
- Badly Wounded are slower, will regenerate health if eaten
- Mortally wounded are much slower and will constantly lose health points until dead

Hunger: Full, Satisfied, Hungry, Very Hungry, Starving
- When very hungry or starving, targets may change
- Starving creatures are slower and will constantly lose health points until they have eaten

Thirst: Full, Satisfied, Thirsty, Very Thirsty, Severely Dehydrated
- When very thirsty or severely dehydrated, targets may change
- Severely dehydrated creatures are slower and will constantly lose health points until they have drank



Night time & caves:
- If a creature is not in a cave at night (24:00), it will die.
- At (24:00), a panel is displayed showing information from the night
- The time skips to the start of the next day (07:00)
- Caves can hold multiple of the same creature type; 3 Wolves, 5 foxes, 10 rabbits
- If a creature approaches a cave with weaker creatures inside, the weaker creatures will flee


2 predator tiers, 1 prey

pred 1 > pred 2 > prey 1


Further notes on creature conditions & target acquisition:

pred 1 hunts pred 2 normally
pred 1 will hunt other pred 1s if starving and target is wounded
pred 1 will eat dead pred 1s and dead pred 2s

pred 2 hunts prey 1 normally
pred 2 will follow other mortally wounded pred 2s if very hungry
pred 2 will always run from pred 1
pred 2 will eat dead 1s and dead 2s if very hungry

prey 1 will keep distance from pred 1 but not run
prey 1 always runs from pred 2
